A sample app created with the purpose of implementing some of the knowledge and concepts that I have learned about flutter app development.

The app uses the openlibrary.org api, that contains information about books.

The app allows you to search, filter the search, see the details of a book and have a list of favorites.

This application was developed following design and architecture good practices, clean architecture.

This app uses the following libraries:

- flutter_bloc (cubit): state management
- hive: local database
- dio: http client
